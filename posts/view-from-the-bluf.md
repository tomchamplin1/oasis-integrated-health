# View from the BLUF

**T﻿he first view from the BLUF is Nutrition.**

This is a very heated subject. So many opinions, so many experts, so much division. It does not have to be this way. Simply put, nutrition is very individual-dependent. This is part of how it becomes so confusing – one nutritional approach works beautifully for one person or one group of people, but  that doesn’t mean you can go online and tell everyone that this is the one nutritional approach to rule them all. No one nutritional approach will be a “grand unifying theory”, proscriptive and equally effective for everyone. Again, we have to help you figure out the unique nutritional method that works best according to your uniqueness. BUT, regardless of the “nutrition” expert you most closely align with there are several very clear principles that should guide your choices:

## P﻿rinciples for nutrition

1. **Eat whole food sourced/produced healthily and optimally..** 

It is important to eat organic and well-sourced foods. There is a common list of the dirty dozen. These fruits and vegetables always need to be consumed organic if possible. 

Fruits: Apples, blueberries, peaches, grapes, cherries, pears, nectarines, and strawberries

Veggies: Spinach, Greens: mustard, kale, collard, Peppers (spicy and mild), green beans

\*\*These foods contain the most pesticides. 

\*\*Buy local (if possible), grow your own or buy organic from grocery. 

2. **Minimized (or completely remove!) processed food.**

Processed food contains many more ingredients than the homemade versions. These are typically sugars, unhealthy oils and chemical preservatives. 

There are some commercially available “Processed foods” that are healthy. 

Examples: 

RAO’s sauces. This brand uses organic and pressure cooked vegetables and no preservatives or flavor enhancers. 

Simple Mills crackers: They have limited ingredients; the only ‘unhealthy’ ingredient is the organic sunflower seed oil. They are made with nut flours and organic ingredients with no preservatives. 

FAT SNAX: They use whole food ingredients, no chemicals. They don’t use organic ingredients. 

Gimme roasted seaweed: This is organic seaweed with avocado oil and salt. That’s it. 

Siete products: Siete brand goes to great lengths to provide gluten free, healthy snacks. As a whole they generally use healthy oils, whole food ingredients without preservatives. 

These are just a few examples of already prepared snacks and foods that will not harm your health. Simply replace your common snacks with products such as these. 

 3. **Seasonal variation in foods.** 

Eat what would be in season. This means fruit in the season it would naturally occur. For example: Berries in Spring and Summer, apples and pears in late Summer and Fall. Greens: Winter, Spring and Summer. Greens typically die off with the high heat of late Summer and early Fall. Root vegetables Fall and Winter etc...

4. Minimize – or all together remove – ‘unhealthy fats’

This is very important as these fats create free radicals that cause damage to our vessel lining. They also cause inflammation which causes our gut to leak. This can cause a person to develop chronic disease and autoimmunity.

Unhealthy fats include: canola/rapeseed oil, cottonseed, corn oil, soy, sunflower, safflower, grapeseed and rice bran oil.

When you buy vegetable oil it is typically a combination of these unhealthy oils. 

Over time the inflammation can interact with your bodies ability to respond to hormones and play an important role in hormone imbalance. 

5. **Reduce simple carbohydrates.**

We all love simple carbohydrates: sweet things such as sugar, fruit, crackers, chips etc… These are foods that convert to glucose with just one or two chemical reactions. They spike your blood glucose causing your body to produce too much insulin. The most important factor is they offer little nutritional value. 

Insulin, though necessary, causes inflammation when out of balance. You want just enough carbs with just enough insulin. 

There is more to this and we will discuss it later in another post. 

AS A VERY GENERAL RULE, most people can not consume more than 100-150 simple carbohydrates per day without metabolic consequences. Some would argue this is still way too many simple carbs. But most will agree as a whole population, Americans eat too many simple carbohydrates as evidenced by epidemic levels of obesity and metabolic disease–which did not exist ONE generation ago. 

6. **Absolutely minimize simple sugar.**

Sugar in all of its forms: granulated, syrups, fruits needs to be limited. When you do consume sugar it too needs to organic. There are some sugars which spike blood glucose more than others: agave, honey, table sugar, over ripe fruit (bananas etc…)

There are some other lower glycemic sugars such as: coconut sugar, xylitol, monkfruit. These can be used in cooking and taste great. 

They are not as sweet as table sugar. Over time you will discover your palate changes and you do not need as much sweetness. 

7. **Have fun with food.** Make cooking a hobby that you love – try new things and don’t stress about it! 

Cooking and creating new things can become a way of life. Instead of rushing through every meal, just stuffing food down begin to plan out meals. 

Start by planning a few new meals a week and add those into your diet. 

When you eat out or buy premade meals, unless you have fully vetted the products, they contain ingredients you can not pronounce and do not what they are. We should be able to identify what is in our food. What we put in our body matters. 

### L﻿earn to cook

When I got married, I did not know how to cook. I bought the Vegetarian Express Cookbook and cooked through the entire book. Adding meat for my husband. I am no longer a vegetarian, but I still love vegetables. Buy a whole food, limited ingredient cookbook and cook. There is a learning curve in the beginning but you will catch on quickly.

Another easy way to incorporate healthy cooking is through a delivery food service such as Green Chef, Fresh Choice etc… Once again choose lower carbohydrate, organic meals. These meals take about 30 minutes to construct. They arrive with ALL the ingredients necessary. 

An instant pot cookbook is a wonderful resource. With a little planning, you can have a hot, healthy meal prepared when you arrive home. This method even makes food more easily digestible and less inflammatory! More on this to come… 

Last but not least, utilize the internet! The internet is an immense resource for ANY type of food you want to cook. Just put a few simple parameters in your search: 

Keto: Will get you lower carbohydrate food without many grains. These will have more meat and healthy fat. 

Low Carbohydrate: Will yield similar results but without an emphasis on meat.

Plant-based: Will yield results that have greater vegetable content and less meat. 

Pescatarian: Fish is your protein.

Keto vegetarian: No animal protein but low in refined carbohydrates and higher in healthy fats and vegetables.  

C﻿arnivore: Primarily meat. T﻿hese are just some of the searches that will yield easy to follow recipes. 

Regardless of which approach you take, soon you will find yourself riffing off recipes and altering food to your tastes. 

With these simple changes, you will improve your health and begin to bring systems back into balance. Make this activity with your family and spouse. It will be enjoyable and create lasting memories. 

As mentioned previously, for quick, “convenient” food we trade our health. But it does not have to be that way. 

M﻿ost importantly, do not stress over your diet. Eat wisely, begin to make better choices and over time they will add up to big changes.
