Ozempic (this is the brand name for Semaglutide) is a medication designed to treat Type II Diabetes. Ozempic is the commercial name given to a peptide semaglutide by its pharmaceutical manufacturer–Novo Nordisk. 

Semaglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist. What does that mean? GLP stands for glucagon-like peptide, an incretin hormone that has several effects. Semaglutide works by behaving like the incretin that the body makes naturally. It has been FDA approved for BOTH treatment of diabetes and weight loss.

Glucagon is a hormone that prevents the blood sugar from going too low. It is a check and balance in the body that makes sure the body and its vital organs have enough energy. 

#### How does Semaglutide work? 

Semiglutide and other GLP-1 receptor agonists work in several ways:

1. They cause your body to release more insulin 
2. They decrease the amount of glucagon (which means the liver releases less glucose)
3. They slow the release of food from your stomach
4. They are involved in telling your brain when you are full–increased satiety 
5. They suppress neuroinflammation which is a central issue in harmful processes like dementia, or Parkinsonism
6. Encourages Beta Cell regeneration–and Beta cells make insulin
7. They increase glucose uptake into peripheral tissue–which means it helps to remove excess glucose from the bloodstream

Because of these actions, patients are able to lose as much as 10% of body weight, and often even more. 

It helps regulate blood sugar levels, address the underlying metabolic dysfunction, and can even improve cognitive functioning over time. Semaglutide is not just beneficial for those with diabetes but can be useful in weight loss and potentially in prevention of major cardiac events and neuroprotection. 

#### What are some of the benefits of semaglutide? 

1. Weight loss
2. Lower A1C (marker and measurement of diabetes)
3. Very low risk of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) compared to some of the other ‘diabetes medicines’. 
4. Lower blood pressure (via weight loss effect)
5. Lower cholesterol levels
6. Helps prevent the onset of diabetes type II
7. Lower risk of cardiovascular disease
8. Lower risk of kidney disease

#### Is semaglutide safe? 

Yes.  In all clinical trials GLP-1 receptor agonists have proven to be safe options for weight loss and treatment of diabetes type II. Although some of the animal models have shown risks such as pancreatitis, medullary thyroid carcinoma, or severe hypoglycemia, this has not been consistently demonstrated in studies with humans. There are questions your medical provider will cover with you to make sure that the medication is optimized as far as safety for you (ANY medication can have interactions and other issues related to safety). 

There are side effects, potentially, though not in all people. 

The most common side effects are GastroIntestinal (GI) related such as nausea, diarrhea, and sometimes vomiting. 

These side effects are usually self-limiting and/or decrease over time. 

If you are using once weekly dosing, these GI side effects tend to be transient –- such as on the day you receive the medication. These side effects also diminish over time. 

Some pharmacies are combining semaglutide with vitamin B-6 which decreases these GI side effects. 

If you are obese and/or have diabetes type 2 then  there is a good chance your insurance will cover the commercial version of Ozempic; however, if your insurance will not cover the cost, then we work with compounding pharmacies that sell the peptide at a much more manageable price. Price for cash pay at a commercial/standard pharmacy, however, will be surprisingly high. Price will not be an insurmountable variable. 

#### How is semaglutide taken? 

Semaglutide can be prescribed in both an oral variation or a tiny once a week subcutaneous injection into an area of fat. Both preparations are effective but there is more research/data (and more weight loss) with the injectable version. 

By addressing the underlying metabolic processes involved in diabetes type II and obesity, you can lose weight, keep it off, and possibly reverse the harms that come with both diseases. 

Oasis Integrated Health will partner with you to design a comprehensive weight loss program that addresses your lifestyle obstacles, financial barriers, neurogenomic profile and underlying disease processes. 

Let us help you unleash your healthiest self.
