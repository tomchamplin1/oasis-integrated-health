# "﻿BLUF" for Wellness

The bottom line up front for wellness:

Let us help you keep it simple, with the Bottom Line Up Front – the B.L.U.F. ! !

Health care, especially wellness, can become overwhelmingly (or almost hopelessly) complicated. That is why it is our goal to give you wellness which is digestible and applicable. 



**7 Principles of Wellness for “The Simple Life”:**

* Optimize Nutrition
* Optimize Exercise
* Optimize Brain
* Optimize Cellular function through decreasing toxins
* Optimize with Genomics
* Optimize Life – Make it simple
* Optimize Mental Health



Over the last 10-15 years we have continuously processed and refined the constantly evolving medical literature as it relates to optimized health and wellness. We do not want to wait for disease and then react, or slowly watch disease steal away at our vitality. We do not want to simply have the attitude, ’this is in my genetics and this is my destiny–there’s nothing I can do.’  



Through this lens we have developed these 7 principles of health which we call, “The Simple Life”. Our medical practice focuses on integrating wellness optimization as both western medical primary care and also more progressive principles of medical health. It can become VERY difficult for patients to track all the variables associated with making this optimized. That is our job–to do the detailed work and present recommendations to you in a way that is simpler, more manageable–something that integrates into your life in a way that is really doable and liveable. 



So many of us rush, strive, work and serve others without giving a thought to what this is doing to our health. Health frequently doesn’t make the list on day by day priorities, because it takes SO much effort to even start to know what helps, what hurts, and sort out the signal among the noise online. Health is tabled for ‘some day soon’. It doesn’t have to be such a massive investment of time sorting through a million hits on an internet search to know which coffee to drink, if you should drink it at all, or if a plastic container is going to give you cancer, or if you are taking the right vitamins, or if Mercury in fish will cause dementia! There is too much to read and too much confusion on which blog or which video is real and what is hyperbole–or even completely false. This is exhausting!



Convenience has a cost. Like my grandmother, a product of the Great Depression, and a very hard worker used to always say, “Nothing worth having is easy.” As a child and young adult this used to frustrate me, but as a wife of 28 years, mother of 4 children, a health care provider, I can say she is right. With any relationship – whether the one with yourself or loved ones or even God – if you leave it unattended it will wither. The easy life may be the greatest lie of all. No, it takes SOME effort, but likely LESS than you think–and the payoff is tremendous!



Over time we will lay out 7 posts that will fill in our discoveries on each of these pillars. We do the leg work, and then bring this to you in simple recommendations, or intermediate detail, or even go down the rabbit hole with you if you like the nitty gritty! Whatever level you are at, we want to translate the language of being in optimal health to your level of understanding and then coordinate it to fit into your life in a way that is concise, manageable and sustainable.
