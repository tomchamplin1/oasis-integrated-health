Simple Nutrition.

T﻿his is a follow up to our first post on nutrition. I wanted to simplify it even further for people. Nutrition has become such a 'hot button' for many. I just want to say up front, it is not so much which diet camp you subscribe to but the quality of the food you are eating. By eating quality food, produced in an ethical and humane way we honor the earth, the animals, and ourselves. 

There is no one perfect diet for everyone. 

We are all different. 

\
My husband and I are health nuts. For nearly 20 years, we have been and continue to experiment with diet. We have tried everything from vegan to carnivore. I think all of them have something to bring to the table. 

This is how we eat.

There are a few and only a few food rules we follow:



1. **Clean meat**. 

Pastured, free-range, antibiotic free and from regenerative farms is what we strive to purchase. Meat has fat. Fat stores toxins in all creatures (including us!). So, if we eat a toxic cow, chicken, pig or fish, we are consuming their toxic fat. 

2. **Organic vegetables**.  

Local when possible. We live in an area with limited resources. This means we are not perfect with this! Organic vegetables have fewer pesticides, more nutrients, and fewer endocrine disrupting chemicals. 

\
3.  **3/4 of plate is plant based.**

Most of your plate 3/4 needs to be plant based and 1/4 a good quality protein source. 

Eat plant food as close to its form in nature. A quick sauté, or broil allows for preservation of nutrients more than a fried, mashed or heavily processed vegetable. 

\
4.  **Limit alcohol**. 

It is just not good for you. Benefits are over exaggerated. A glass of wine or one beer or one mixed drink is fine, but more than that cannot be supported as healthy. That is not to say we NEVER have a few drinks, however, not on a regular basis. 

5. **Eat at home.**  

It is just better. Less ingredients, less expensive but way better for you. Simple meals limit one’s exposure to toxins and harmful additives. They can be delicious too! 

O﻿f course we eat out. Just not everyday. We reserve eating out for gathering with your friends or special occasions with family or just cause a night or so a week. 

6. **No gluten**. 

Our family cannot process gluten. So, we don’t eat it as a rule. Both my husband and I have genes that make us more sensitive to gluten. These have been given to our children. Gluten is inflammatory for EVERYONE. Having said that some people handle it fine. If you have an autoimmune issue or gut issues, gluten is not recommended at all. 

7. **Limit sugar**. 

We eat sugar but not on a daily basis. It is a treat. I love nothing more than having a few dark chocolate chips after dinner.

If we must sweeten, we use monk fruit, allulose, or erythritol. Monk fruit does not negatively affect gut bacteria like sugar and other ‘heathy sweeteners’. We do not use any of them all the time. 

Here are links to the sweeteners we love: 

Swerve: <https://amzn.to/498scaN>

Allulose: <https://amzn.to/48MGO03>

8﻿. **Eat healthy oils.**

T﻿he food industry has moved to using cheap oils. There are only a few truly healthy oils. We use only avocado oil, coconut oil, or olive oil. All of these organic and minimally processed. 

H﻿ere are a few brands we use: 

Olive oil: https://amzn.to/3vSVDQ2 

A﻿vocado oil: https://amzn.to/3ugaN16

C﻿oconut oil: https://amzn.to/48Sff5m

9. **Eat early and together.**

Eat 3 hours before bed. This is better for sleep. This is not necessarily a nutrition hack but rather a life hack — that has to do with food!

The process of sharing a meal with people you love produces oxytocin which makes us happy. It is good for our mental health, gut health and overall wellbeing. Just the act of slowing down to take the time to eat with your partner, friends, or family reduces stress hormones and increases digestion. We share meals with each other, our one child at home as well as friends and family as much as possible.

10. **Drink filtered Water**.

We have been filtering our water for years. City water contains microplastics, bacteria, pharmacies waste. Here are several brands we like.

Y﻿ou may have noticed I did not mention exact macros. This because if you follow those rules, you do not have to spend so much time counting and calulating macros. You will get enough of just about everything!

R﻿emember, eating is more than just food. It is a celebration of the day to come and the day that has been!
